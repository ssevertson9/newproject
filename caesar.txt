A soliiloquy of Marc Anthony

O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever lived and lived in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men
Domestic fury and fierce civl strife

Shall cumber all the parts of Italy
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
